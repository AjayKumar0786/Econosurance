                    <h2 class="">It makes little difference whether you are a first-time buyer or looking for your
                        second or third home — shopping for a house is stressful.</h2>

                    <p>You need to first get your taxes, paperwork, and legalities in order before you can even begin to
                        consider whether you like a property or not. Only then can you start asking, "Is it big
                        enough?", "Is the location right for me?", "Will it require any repairs?", "How much will it
                        cost to maintain?", and so on. The questions could go on endlessly.</p>

                    <p>But there is one question you should never forget to ask: "What kind of insurance am I going to
                        get?"</p>

                    <p>It might seem strange to contemplate your house's destruction or damage when buying it for the
                        first time, yet it plays a huge role in the expenses that come with owning a house. Insurance
                        premiums can eat into a household budget over the years – something that can be avoided if given
                        careful consideration beforehand.</p>

                    <p>To qualify for the best home insurance policy available, it is essential to know what insurance
                        companies are looking for when evaluating a property. It is not just about insurance, it will
                        make you a savvier buyer too. Knowing what questions to ask about the condition of a house, such
                        as its plumbing, heating, and construction from roof to walls, can save you hundreds and
                        thousands in the long run. Plus, you will end up living in a sturdier and higher-quality home.

                    <p>In this guide, we discuss the critical aspects of buying a home with insurance in mind, as well
                        as the factors that will render a property ineligible for the most preferable home insurance
                        programs.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Roof & Siding</strong></h4>
                    <p class="mt-lg-2">Although roofs form an expensive part of a house, oftentimes people give it far
                        too little thought when choosing their new home. However, there are several key things to keep
                        in mind.</p>
                    <p>First, when buying a house, the roof should have a life expectancy of at least 5 years.</p>
                    <p>Second, buyers should familiarize themselves with different roof designs, such as gable, hip,
                        mansard, gambrel, and flat, and roofing materials. Certain roof styles, such as hip roofs, can
                        get you a discount, while the quality of roofing material will determine how soon a roof needs
                        to be replaced.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Electricity</strong></h4>
                    <p>On average, electric systems cause 34,000 home structure fires annually. Therefore, it is
                        essential to understand the age and quality of the circuit breakers, wiring, and light fixtures.
                        E.g., if the electrical system is older than 50 years, then you might want to replace it.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, certain elements, such as aluminum wiring or Stab-Lok circuit breakers, will
                        automatically leave you ineligible for the best insurance policies.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-12 medium-lists">
                    <h4><strong>Heating</strong></h4>
                    <p>Heating systems have a huge impact on the value of a house. Understanding the differences between
                        central heating, where a furnace or boiler heats air or water, respectively, and distributes it
                        throughout the house, and a direct heat source, such as a stove or floor furnace, will help you
                        save money over time.</p>
                    <p>The wear and tear of a heating system is typically not covered by home insurance. Thus, the age
                        and state of a heating system might determine whether you should invest in a particular
                        property.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Plumbing</strong></h4>
                    <p>Home insurance will not cover a property’s plumbing for long-term leaks, negligence, old
                        plumbing, or sump pump flooding. Knowing the age of the plumbing system, the piping material,
                        and the general quality are vital to assessing whether a property might incur large expenses or
                        is instead a sound investment.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Construction</strong></h4>
                    <p>For properties older than 30 years, insurance premiums can increase by 1% for every extra 5 to 10
                        years. It probably goes without saying that buying a newer property will save you money.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, you should also think about the construction materials. Wooden frame houses can
                        impose a fire risk, whereas masonry is more robust and durable. Hence, wooden frame properties
                        cost more to insure than masonry. </p>
                    <h4><strong>Location</strong></h4>
                    <p>Houses closer to a fire station or fire hydrant are more likely to qualify for the best home
                        insurance policies, whereas homes at risk of natural disasters are going to need more expensive
                        insurance.</p>
                    <p>Houses near cliffs, major bodies of water, and on mountainsides will be ineligible for the best
                        policies.</p>

                    <h2>How to Think Like an <strong> Insurance Agent</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <p class="mt-lg-3">It is essential to understand the two most important questions insurers ask
                        themselves when reviewing a home:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> How much would it cost to rebuild the house? </li>
                        <li> Will part of the home need to be replaced or rebuilt in the near future?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>These two questions are vital to understanding how insurers think. Essentially, they are looking
                        to spend as little as possible and want the home to be in as good condition as possible,
                        relative to the price of the house as a whole.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Roof & Siding</strong></h2>
                    <p>A lot of people do not inspect the roof or siding of a house when they start looking for a new
                        home, yet the roof is one of the most expensive parts of a house. Roofs should be in a good
                        condition and have at least a 5-year life expectancy. If your heart is set on a particular
                        property, it is sensible to arrange an inspection of the property, including the roof, to avoid
                        any bad surprises down the line.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-12 big-lists mt-lg-4">
                    <h3><strong>Roof Design</strong></h3>
                    <p>Roof designs differ depending on the location, with higher-pitched roofs being more common in
                        areas with high levels of rain or snow. Meanwhile, flatter roofs are more common in drier
                        environments. Here are the most common roofing types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong> Gable roof: </strong> A gable refers to the triangular end of a roof. Also known as
                            pitched or peaked roofs. </li>
                        <li><strong> Hip roof: </strong> Hip roofs have slopes on all four sides, with sides of equal
                            length meeting to form the spine of the house. </li>
                        <li><strong> Mansard roof: </strong> A two-sloped roof, with a gentle upper slope, and a second
                            steep scalloped slope. Also known as a French roof. </li>
                        <li><strong> Gambrel roof: </strong> Gambrel or barn roofs resemble a mansard, except the upper
                            slope is steeper, and the lower slope descends almost vertically down the side of the house.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong> Flat roof: </strong> A flat surface, frequently with items placed on it, e.g.,
                            ventilation devices, roof gardens, or solar panels. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Houses with a hip roof covering the entire structure may be eligible for a discount of up to 10%
                        off the insurance policy, as the design has an increased ability to withstand high winds.
                        However, hip roof houses with skylights or overhangs might not be eligible for the most
                        preferable policies.</p>

                        (unless made of poured concrete).</p>

                    <p>Inquire about any asbestos on the property, as removal is exceedingly expensive due to the
                        carcinogenic properties. As such, asbestos is not eligible for coverage, either as a roof or
                        siding. Masonite, EIFS (exterior insulation finishing system), and Dryvit (a synthetic version
                        of cement siding) sidings are also ineligible for the preferred homeowners’ programs. </p>

                    <p>Additionally, roofs made from non-combustible materials are naturally considered to be a superior
                        construction. In areas prone to wildfire, this is especially important to consider.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Roof Condition</strong></h3>
                    <p>The newer the roof, the better. If the roof is old, you may want to negotiate the price of the
                        house down to compensate for the additional cost. For many insurers, composite shingle roofs
                        must be no more than 20 years old, and for metal and concrete and clay tile roofs, they must not
                        be older than 25 years.</p>

                    <p>If the house you are set on has an old roof, you will need to decide how long you plan to live in
                        the property, and whether the cost of a new roof is worth the investment. If the inspector tells
                        you that there are only a few shingles missing or are curling/buckling, then it may be worth
                        spending the money. However, if the roof is sagging due to structural damage or significant
                        leakage, it may not be worth the investment.</p>
                    <p>Finally, if a tree is overhanging the roof or is deemed to be in dangerous proximity, the house
                        may be ineligible for the preferred homeowners’ programs. Consider trimming back tree branches
                        if possible.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Electricity</strong></h2>
                    <p>Whenever you buy a new property, it is crucial to get the specifications of the electrical system
                        irrespective of age. When was it installed? When was it last inspected? Have there been any
                        previous issues? These are all vital questions to ask. Especially considering old wiring is a
                        significant fire risk. According to the US Fire Administration, around 34,000 home structures
                        catch fire annually due to electrical distribution and lighting fittings, which cost a whopping
                        $1.4 billion in direct property damage.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">As with all aspects of home insurance, the older the electrical system, the more you are likely
                        to pay in insurance premium. Here are some specific elements of a house's electrical system to
                        ask about:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Circuit breakers </strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Light fixtures</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Electric receptacles</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Wiring</strong>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 mt-lg-4 big-lists ">
                    <p> In regards to wiring, knob and tube wiring (K&T) – a method of wiring used from around 1880 to
                        the 1930s – and aluminum wiring that has not been adequately modified are ineligible for the
                        best home insurance policies and should be considered red flags. Federal Pacific Electric (FPE)
                        panels with Stab-Lok circuit breakers – which were commonly used in homes built between 1950 and
                        1990 – are also ineligible. Tests performed since the 1980s found that one in four Stab-Lok
                        breakers were defective and would not trip off properly. Fuses are also ineligible for the best
                        homeowners’ programs.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, homes more than 50 years old will require the replacement of the entire electrical
                        system to be eligible for coverage unless it has been replaced not that long ago.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Heating</strong></h2>
                    <p>Heating is a crucial element of a building. The different types of heating systems and their
                        relative cost also affect your insurance differently. You need to know the heating system's age
                        and whether any updates have been made in the past decade to accurately estimate its impact on
                        the cost of insurance. </p>
                    <h3><strong>Types of Heating System</strong></h3>
                    <h4><strong>Central Heating</strong></h4>
                    <h6>Furnaces</h6>
                    <p>The majority of North American households still rely upon a central furnace to provide heat. The
                        furnace works by blowing heated air through ducts to provide the rooms with warm air. The
                        furnace can be either oil- or gas-fired, though some forced warm-air systems also use electric
                        heaters.</p>
                    <p>In regards to furnaces, most insurers do not cover normal wear and tear, while damage due to
                        fire, theft, or natural disasters is covered. Make sure you find out the age of the furnace and
                        its general condition before purchasing the house.</p>
                    <p>Make sure to also ask whether there is an underground fuel tank, as these can render the property
                        ineligible for the best coverage available, irrespective of whether the fuel tank is in use.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-6 mt-lg-5">
                    <p><img src="./images/Shape-4.png " class="img-fluid w-100 medium-lists-img "
                            alt="How the Cost Is Determined"></p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 big-lists">
                    <h6>Boilers</h6>
                    <p>If furnaces heat air, then boilers heat water. The warm water is then distributed through the
                        house's rooms via radiators, which disseminate the heat. The cooled water is returned to the
                        boiler for reheating. Boilers can be fuelled by either oil or gas, and use a pump to circulate
                        the hot water.</p>
                    <p>Typically, boilers are not covered by home insurance, so you need to buy specific boiler
                        insurance that can be purchased. If the boiler is older than 15 years, then the boiler coverage
                        options will be limited. Having your boiler break down in the depths of winter without the money
                        for a new one is a situation no one wants to find themselves in, so boiler insurance could be a
                        worthy investment.</p>
                    <h6>Heat Pump/Geothermal</h6>
                    <p>Heat pumps have become increasingly popular. A ground source heat pump uses the differential
                        between above-ground air temperature and subsurface soil temperature to aid in space heating or
                        cooling, as well as water heating. Meanwhile, in some locations, geothermal energy can be
                        directly accessed by driving pipes several hundred feet into the ground. These systems can
                        circulate the water in a continuous circuit (closed-loop system), or the water can be dispersed
                        back into the ground after it comes to the surface (open-loop system).</p>
                    <p>Since heat pumps are outdoors, they are susceptible to wind and storm damage. These are typically
                        listed as peril on a homeowner's insurance policy and will be covered. Most units will last
                        between 15 to 20 years, so find out the age and when it is going to be needing replacement. The
                        insurance policy does not cover wear and tear, but you can buy specific heat pump insurance
                        policies.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Direct Heat</strong></h4>
                    <p>Many sources of direct heat will save you money on your annual heating cost. Some
                        estimates predict a reduction of 20-40%, but direct heat sources can increase your risk of fire.
                        Generally, a fire caused by alternative heating sources is covered by home insurance, as fire
                        counts as a covered peril.</p>

                    <h6>Gas-Fired Space Heaters
                    </h6>

                    <p>Wall-mounted, free-standing, or floor furnaces can be used to provide a direct source of heat, as
                        opposed to heating air and forcing it through the property. Generally, these devices are used
                        for heating a single room.</p>
                    <p>These heaters are subject to similar policies as apply to central heating furnaces.</p>
                    <h6>Electric Space Heaters</h6>
                    <p>Portable "plug-in" electric heaters are cheap to buy but expensive to run. As a rule, insurers
                        generally do not approve of electric space heaters due to the increase in fire risk. </p>
                    <h6>Wood-Burning and Pellet Stoves</h6>

                    <p>Wood-burning stoves are permitted only if professionally installed and are used in conjunction
                        with another primary source of heat. However, a wood-burning surcharge may be applied. On
                        average, wood stoves increase home insurance rates by two percent. If a house has a wood-burning
                        stove, installing smoke detectors and purchasing a fire extinguisher can reduce your insurance
                        costs. </p>

                    <h4><strong>State of the Art Heating</strong></h4>
                    <h6>Radiant Floor Heat</h6>
                    <p>Radiant floor heat is a system of underfloor tubing circulating heated water through the house,
                        thereby warming the room. The system is expensive to install but offers a high degree of
                        control. Insurance companies will want to know the age of the unit used to heat the water. Also,
                        while most insurers will cover damage from burst piping, they will want to know the system's age
                        and prior maintenance.</p>

                    <p>Many policies probably will not cover burst or frozen pipes, especially if you have been away
                        from the property for a prolonged period. However, as the system has a lifespan of over 100
                        years, it is unlikely that you are going to have to replace it.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Plumbing</strong></h2>
                    <p>As with electric systems, the newer the plumbing, or the more recently it has been upgraded, the
                        less you will spend on home insurance. Make sure to ask about the water piping's age, whether
                        there has been a history of leaks, and if there are any repairs currently required.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0"> Plumbing damage repairs and expenses usually are covered by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><Strong> Dwelling coverage: </Strong> Used for damage done to overall house structure, e.g.,
                            a burst pipe causing damage to the walls.</li>
                        <li><Strong> Property coverage: </Strong> Any personal property in your home that is damaged
                            will be replaced up to a specific monetary value</li>
                        <li><Strong> Additional living expenses coverage: </Strong> If extensive repairs are required,
                            you may need other accommodation while away from home.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="mb-0">However, there are a few occasions when an insurance provider will deny your claim:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong> Long-term leak: </strong> If you purchase a property with a prior leak, you will
                            not be covered by your insurance provider.</li>
                        <li><strong> Negligence: </strong> As mentioned, insurance companies expect property owners to
                            heat their homes and prevent burst pipes during the winter months. Therefore, if you are
                            purchasing a home for seasonal use, be aware of this risk during the winter.</li>
                        <li><strong> Old plumbing: </strong> Plumbing, which shows signs of rust, wear, or corrosion.
                            Your provider will not pay for its replacement or repair. It is your responsibility to
                            ensure the plumbing is maintained to a good standard. It is worth inspecting the pipes
                            yourself, or paying for a professional to inspect the property if you are concerned about
                            the overall age of the structure or its general upkeep.</li>
                        <li><strong> Sump pump inflicted: </strong> Sump pumps are used to keep a building dry and
                            prevent flooding. Therefore, as the sump pump is designed to avoid damage, an optional
                            add-on sump pump coverage will cover any damage caused by a malfunctioning pump. A standard
                            policy does not cover such damage, so ask if the property has a sump pump.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, homes with polybutylene, PEX, or galvanized plumbing systems are not eligible for
                        the best programs. PEX systems installed post-2011 will be considered with underwriting
                        approval. Also, homes older than 50 years require the replacement of pressurized lines to be
                        eligible.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Swimming Pools / Hot Tubs</strong></h2>
                    <p class="mt-lg-2">If the property has a swimming pool, hot tub, or spa, you will be eligible for
                        coverage only if the facility is maintained and in working condition. Diving boards and slides
                        are not permitted. Swimming pools must be protected by a locking fence at least four feet in
                        height, or another suitable approved enclosure. Hot tubs must also be enclosed under similar
                        rules, as well as possessing a secure cover.</p>
                    <p>You will also need additional liability coverage in case of injury. Currently, the Insurance
                        Information Institute recommends all pool owners increase their liability to $300,000 or
                        $500,000, increasing your annual home insurance bill by $50 and $75, respectively.</p>
                    <p>Some homeowners with swimming pools or other aquatic features undertake an umbrella policy, in
                        which additional protection for injury and being sued are covered. A $1 million umbrella policy
                        will increase the cost by $200 to $300 annually. Otherwise, pools will only increase policy
                        costs by less than one percent, and so can be considered negligible. But it pays to have enough
                        liability coverage.</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>Age of the Property</strong></h3>
                    <p>First, you will want to know the age of the property. As a rule of thumb, insurers charge more
                        for older homes, as the rebuilding costs will be greater following damage or destruction. For
                        instance, plaster walls, stained glass, hardwood flooring, ornate moldings, etc. Therefore,
                        insurers will increase annual policy costs accordingly.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">On average, this is how much age can increase the cost of the policy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 30-years-old: 1% increase</li>
                        <li> 35-years-old: 2% increase</li>
                        <li> 40-years-old: 2% increase</li>
                        <li> 45-years-old: 3% increase</li>
                        <li> 50-years-old: 3% increase</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Homes built post-2007 can incur a discount of up to 10% if they meet protection requirements and
                        the current International Building Code.</p>

                    <h3> <strong> Exterior Walls</strong>
                    </h3>
                    <p class="mt-lg-3">Determining the construction materials of the exterior load-bearing walls is a
                        relatively simple task. Here are some common insurance definitions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><Strong> Frame / Stucco on Frame / Hardiplank over Frame: </Strong> Exterior walls of wood
                            or other combustible materials. Examples include wood-iron clad, stucco on wood, or plaster
                            on combustible supports, aluminum, or plastic siding over a frame.</li>
                        <li><Strong> Masonry Veneer: </Strong> Exterior walls constructed of masonry materials such as
                            brick or stone over the frame.</li>
                        <li><Strong> Masonry / Stucco on Masonry: </Strong> Exterior walls were constructed purely of
                            masonry materials, including adobe, concrete, gypsum block, hollow concrete block, stone,
                            tile, or similar materials, and floors and roofing of combustible construction.</li>
                        <li><Strong> Superior Construction: </Strong> Exterior walls, floors, and roofs constructed of
                            masonry or other non-combustible materials.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The four classifications descend in order of superiority, as buildings made of non-combustible
                        masonry materials do not succumb as easily to destruction.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-12 big-lists mt-lg-4">

                    <p>Buildings, which are a combination of brick/block and frame construction, are considered frames
                        when the frame construction exceeds thirty percent of the total exterior wall surface area.
                        Otherwise, such walls are classified as brick/block.</p>

                    <p>It may seem like an irrelevant distinction, but on average, brick homes cost 6% less to insure.
                        Homes at the top end of the scale, which are made entirely of non-combustible materials, save on
                        average twelve percent. Meanwhile, according to insurance.com, newly-constructed homes see an
                        average discount of thirty-six percent compared to other homes.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Foundation</strong></h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">As with the Bible story, a house built on sand will not last, regardless of
                        location. Insurers also use such simple principles in determining the viability of a house's
                        foundation. For insurers to bind a policy, it requires:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Pilings (8’ to 10’ elevations)</li>
                        <li> Crawl space – a foundation enclosed by a permanent material, e.g., concrete or brick. If
                            the house has open foundations enclosed by a lattice, it does not qualify as a crawl space.
                        </li>
                        <li> Concrete slab</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Homes built on open foundations are ineligible for the best home insurance policies.</p>
                    <p>All damage to a house's foundation is covered by a policy unless explicitly excluded. As a rule,
                        events that insurance companies reject include natural settling, cracking, or expansion of the
                        foundation, earthquakes or flooding; pressure from tree roots; sinkholes; or faulty
                        construction.</p>
                    <p>Having a structural engineer inspect the foundations can be useful if you are unsure about the
                        viability of a house’s construction.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-12 ">
                    <h3><strong>Building Type</strong></h3>
                    <p>The type of building you choose to buy will not affect whether a policy will cover you, but it
                        can determine which type of coverage you require. Therefore, it is vital to know the difference.
                        Here is a breakdown of the different property types:</p>

                    <h4><strong>Single-Family</strong>
                    </h4>

                    <p>A single-family is defined as any building separate from others by space. Buildings separated by
                        at least 6-inch reinforced concrete or 8-inch masonry walls - that pierce or rise to the
                        underside of the roof and pierce or extend to the inner side of the exterior wall - can also be
                        defined as a single building. If these buildings are classified as a single building, then
                        entryways between buildings must be protected by a Class A Fire Door installed in a masonry
                        wall.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Multi-family</strong></h4>
                    <p>Multi-family dwellings are defined for insurance purposes as dwellings capable of housing more
                        than one family with multiple kitchens, bathrooms, and bedrooms with separating walls between
                        them – are viewed differently than traditional family units. If you live on the property, a
                        standard homeowner’s insurance policy is applicable. However, if you do not reside in the
                        property, then a dwelling and fire policy (in addition to a business owner’s policy) are
                        applicable.</p>

                    <p>For homeowners, the policy includes the structure, personal liability, and replacement of
                        personal property. Whereas, dwelling and fire policy will only cover the structure. Some
                        policies also cover personal liability, though this does not come as standard.</p>


                    <p>Additionally, the following homes are not eligible for coverage: 'Green Homes'; homes with
                        historical designations; mobile, modular, manufactured and prefabricated homes; and homes with
                        burglar bars on the windows without an inside release. </p>

                    <h4><strong>Townhouse or Rowhouse</strong></h4>

                    <p>A townhouse or rowhouse refers to houses that are attached and do not meet the requirements
                        outlined above for single buildings.</p>

                    <p>Policies often depend on the number of 'family units' within a 'Fire Division.' For example, if
                        there were three single-family units joined together. Collectively, they would be considered a
                        Fire Division. However, if a firewall separated the properties, then they would be regarded as
                        separate Fire Divisions. The more family units in a Fire Division, the more risk is incurred by
                        the insurance company.</p>

                    <p>When buying insurance for a townhouse, you often insure the interior of the dwelling, the
                        structure, and the land it is built on. In contrast, in a condominium, you only insure the
                        interior of the residence, as the association is responsible for insuring the structure.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Location</strong></h2>
                    <p>Just as house prices are affected by location, so too are insurance policy costs.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Fire Station</strong></h3>
                    <p>The closer the property is to a fire station or fire hydrants, the lower the cost of your
                        insurance. As a general rule, urban and suburban homes receive better fire protection ratings
                        than rural properties. Usually, being within 5 miles of a fire station and less than 1,000 feet
                        from a fire hydrant is considered desirable by insurance companies. Houses that do not fulfill
                        these criteria should be located on a paved road and be visible to neighbors. On average, homes
                        near a central fire station see a four percent discount.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, homes with polybutylene, PEX, or galvanized plumbing systems are not eligible for
                        the best programs. PEX systems installed post-2011 will be considered with underwriting
                        approval. Also, homes older than 50 years require the replacement of pressurized lines to be
                        eligible.</p>
                    <h3><strong>Natural Features</strong></h3>
                    <p>Homes near a coastline or body of water are at risk of flooding; therefore, they are more
                        expensive to insure than inland properties. Houses at risk of hurricanes may need a separate
                        deductible or even a separate windstorm insurance policy.</p>
                    <p>As such, properties within 2500 feet of the coast or a major body of water are ineligible for
                        preferable coverage. Homes within half a mile of the coast must be located above base flood
                        elevation, according to FEMA. If a house is not considered at high risk of flooding, homeowners
                        often still purchase flood insurance, as an estimated 25% of flood claims come from homes that
                        are not at high risk.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, properties located on mountainsides, cliffs, bluffs, or over water (partially or
                        entirely) are automatically ineligible for the best coverage on the market. Homes near landfill
                        sites or geologically unstable areas cannot receive coverage, as well as houses on a farm or
                        with farming exposure.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Commercial Zoning</strong></h3>
                    <p>Properties located in a commercially zoned neighborhood or adjacent to a commercial property, as
                        well as properties with more than five acres of land, will be referred to underwriting before
                        approval. Meanwhile, properties in the name of any kind of business, including Limited Liability
                        Corporation, Limited Partnership, Corporation, land trust, or estate, are ineligible for the
                        best home insurances..</p>
                    <h2><strong>Occupancy</strong></h2>
                    <p>If you are purchasing a property as a seasonal or secondary residence, then coverage can still be
                        purchased, though usually not with a standard home insurance policy. Vacant and unoccupied
                        properties or those under construction/major renovation are not eligible for the homeowners’
                        program but may be eligible for a dwelling policy.</p>
                    <p>Seasonal residences are defined as being occupied by the owner for less than nine continuous
                        months per year.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Dog Breeds</strong></h2>
                    <p>Certain breeds of dogs can render a property ineligible for the best home insurance coverage.
                        These breeds can include Akitas, American Bulldogs, Bull Mastiffs, Beaucerons, Belgian Malinois,
                        Caucasian Mountain Dogs, Chows, Doberman Pinschers, German Shepherds, Great Danes, Keeshonds,
                        Pit Bulls, Rottweilers, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, Staffordshire Terriers, Wolf Hybrids, or any mix
                        of these breeds. Dogs with a recorded history of biting will also render you ineligible for the
                        best home insurance policies.</p>

                    <p>Some insurers decide on a case-by-case basis or require the homeowner to sign a liability waiver
                        for dog bites.</p>
                    <p>Any exotic animals, farm, saddle, or hooved animals will also render a property ineligible for
                        premium coverage.</p>


                    <h2><strong>Prior Claims</strong></h2>
                    <p>As there is a significant correlation between prior claims made and additional future claims,
                        then the type and number of previous claims can influence your insurance rating. An unacceptable
                        prior loss history might include three or more reported claims within three years, or one or
                        more liability claims within three years.</p>
                    <p>Put simply, the more claims you make, the more your premium increases. Additionally, insurance
                        companies reserve the right to re-rate or non-renew a policy based upon claim activity.</p>
