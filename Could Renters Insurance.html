                            <p class="own-mobile-text mb-0">While it is true that landlord’s policy coverage exists, it
                                does not offer protection to its tenants. For this reason, it is common for landlords to
                                require renter’s insurance from tenants before renting the property to them. In other
                                cases, it will be outlined in a signed agreement that their policy does not cover you as
                                a tenant.</p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">A landlord policy covers structural damages to the building you
                                live in that result from fire, lightning, or storms, not including your personal
                                belongings. </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">When it comes to liabilities, the only one protected is the
                                landlord, such as when a tenant gets injured on the premises. For these reasons, it is
                                important you obtain your own renter’s insurance to be protected.</p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text mb-0">So, a landlord’s insurance policy covers the building in
                                which you reside, but it excludes your personal belongings. Even in cases of accidents
                                in your rented home, you will be held accountable if you are not insured. Therefore, it
                                is always a good idea to get yourself a renter’s insurance policy..</p>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text">If you are not familiar with the term, liability insurance
                                protects the insured party against claims that come from injury or damage caused to
                                other people or their belongings while on the insured property. This type of policy
                                covers the legal costs you may face, as well as any compensation payouts that you might
                                be legally liable for from claims made from another party. However, this only includes
                                unintentional damages caused on your behalf.</p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text mb-1"> Usually, renter’s policies you purchase provide a minimum
                                limit of $100,000 for financial protection for liability claims caused:</p>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text">In some cases, liability coverage includes medical bills of
                                others up to $1,000 per person when it comes to necessary medical expenses following an
                                accident on your property. Higher amounts are also available, but those become available
                                according to your agreement with the insurance company.</p>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text">Although this type of insurance does not cover the damages to

                            <p class="own-mobile-text">Some insurance companies include risks such as credit or debit
                                card thefts, fungi, or even inflation protection in their insurance plans. However, this
                                is not a given, so you will need to check the particular terms of the policy. An
                                independent insurance agent can help you find the best coverage deal for your situation,
                                and can potentially save you hundreds of dollars while giving great coverage.</p>


                            <h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>What should I Consider When Purchasing Renter’s Insurance?
                                </strong></h2>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text mb-">In order to get a personalized insurance policy, you need to
                                consider:</p>

                            <div>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The value of the inventory in your home, and</li>
                                    <li>Whether you want Actual Cash Value (ACV) or Replacement Cost Coverage (RCC).
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </div>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">Creating a home inventory is important because you’ll be able to
                                set coverage appropriate to your situation. This will allow you to create an overall
                                value of your belongings that you’ll want to cover.</p>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text">Additionally, insurance companies usually offer the possibility
                                of replacing your belongings with cash (ACV), covering their exact cost at the moment of
                                purchase, or they can replace the items with new ones at the current market price (RCC).
                            </p>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text">Your insurance agent can help you make a decision on the
                                approximate value of your belongings, as well as what form of return benefits you the
                                most.</p>

                            <h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>Is a Bundled Renter’s Policy Beneficial for me?</strong></h2>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> A bundled policy is normally the best option money-wise. Most
                                insurance brokers suggest a combined home and auto insurance policy. Renter’s coverage
                                is inexpensive coverage that – when combined with an auto policy – reduces the policy
                                rate of the auto aspect. In fact, the discount one receives on the auto policy is nearly
                                as much as the cost for the renter’s policy. So, it can almost be considered a free
                                policy. However, to get all the benefits that come from a bundled renter’s policy, you
                                need an insurance broker that works for your benefit. That is because they learn your
                                personal needs, and help you purchase coverage that works best for you.</p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> If you are not sure how an insurance broker can help you with
                                finding the best deals, you can learn more from the case of one of our own clients here
                                at Econosurance:</p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> Susan, who is one of our clients, called us a few months ago to
                                get one of her friends an insurance package for her rented apartment and her vehicle.
                                After getting her friend a bundled package, we spoke to Susan for a while to also learn
                                more about her. However, that conversation ended there and we did not speak to Susan for
                                months.</p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> Naturally, after months of not speaking, we did not put much
                                thought into her case, but she called us to get her own homeowner’s insurance, given her
                                friend’s satisfaction with our services. However, we were sure that we could get her a
                                better deal so we talked to her further to understand her situation and then opted for a
                                bundled home and auto package.</p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> This policy combination saved Susan over $700 dollars, which
                                made her and us very happy. Our number one priority at Econosurance is to create a
                                conversation rather than a transaction with an insurance client. Apart from saving the
                                client money, we also always seek to create a connection with the client; this ensures
                                high-quality services and satisfied clients.</p>


                            <h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h2>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> All in all, a renter’s policy is very beneficial because it
                                provides protection for your property, against liabilities and unplanned living
                                expenses, and even optional coverage for luxury items and other items such as a high-end
                                bicycle or a scooter. Apart from being affordable on its own, you can save even more
                                money if you bundle your renter’s and auto insurance together!</p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> An insurance broker with ties to different insurance companies
                                can help you find affordable personalized deals. Make sure to ask your agent exactly
                                what your policy covers, as well as keep in touch to find out whether you can benefit
                                from discount policies. This will allow you to get the most of your coverage and make
                                buying insurance a little easier.</p>
