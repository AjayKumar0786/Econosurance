                            </h2>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text mt-lg-3">You’ve decided to move to Massachusetts? Fantastic! Can’t wait to welcome you – you’re going to love it.

                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">Once you get over how lucky you are, it is time to get down to the practicalities; one of which is to obtain or switch a license and registration from another state to Massachusetts. It can be a daunting prospect for many newcomers, primarily because Massachusetts has different requirements compared to many other states.
                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">For example, few states require motorists to obtain a stamped registration form before they are allowed to register a vehicle; however, Massachusetts does. Similarly, many states require you to carry an insurance card, whereas Massachusetts does not. There are many differences to be aware of when registering a car in the state versus elsewhere.
                            </p>
                              <p class="own-mobile-text">If you are considering moving to Massachusetts, you will need to plan carefully. Once you become a Massachusetts resident, you need to convert your license, get a MA registration and have your vehicle inspected at an approved inspection site.</p>
                               <p class="own-mobile-text">Read on to discover the steps you need to complete within 30 days of the date you officially move to the state.</p>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text ">In Massachusetts (Mass), following Governor Charlie Baker's declaration of a State of Emergency on March 10th, the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) has seen substantial delays due to the restriction of services. The Mass RMV is no longer allowing customer visits to their Service Centers and AAA offices.
                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">As such, residents are required to make a reservation online or via phone (at 857-369-8000). Friends and family are not permitted to attend the meetings, except in the case of Learner's Permit applicants, who are allowed an accompanying parent or guardian.</p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text ">
                                Only 10 RMV centers are currently open: Boston/Haymarket, Brockton, Fall River, Lawrence, Leominster (for Learner's Permit only), Pittsfield, Plymouth, South Yarmouth, Springfield, Worcester, Watertown (for Learner's Permit only), and Wilmington (for Commercial Driver's License/Permit Only).
                            </p>
                        <p class="own-mobile-text">At the Wilmington RMV Service Centers, they are exclusively open to commercial transactions on a walk-in basis, including commercial driver’s licenses (CDLs) and permits (CLPs). CDL road tests are also continuing to be administered.</p>
                       <p class="own-mobile-text">All Mass RMV customers must wear face coverings upon entering the Service Center. Social distancing within the Service Centers limits the number of customers allowed into the Service Center at any one time.</p>
                        <p class="own-mobile-text">Due to the demand and relative shortage of appointments, it can take a minimum of two hours to receive an appointment via phone. Then you'll have to wait a further 7 to 10 days for your appointment date. However, we may be able to help you. Please see our helpful guide.</p>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text mb-0">Wouldn't it be so easy to keep the same license no matter what state you live in? Sorry, no such luck. When converting your out-of-state driver's license to a Massachusetts license, you need to decide if you need a <a href="https://www.mass.gov/guides/massachusetts-identification-id-requirements"> REAL ID driver’s license or a Standard Massachusetts driver’s license.</a>  If you don’t know what type of license you need, use the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/guides/rmv-real-id-info-center" >Real Answers Wizard.</a> </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">Due to the State of Emergency, the RMV has suspended the issuing of new REAL IDs, except for the first-time issuance, out-of-state conversion, or other limited circumstances.</p>


                            <p class="own-mobile-text mb-0">Once you've determined the type of license you need, the next step is to take the original ID forms to an RMV Service Center, including the following: </p>
