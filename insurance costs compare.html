                    <p class="mt-lg-2">The ValuePenguin study suggests that the town where you live makes a big
                        difference in your insurance rate. While actuaries are responsible for financial consequences,
                        we don’t know all the elements that go into mitigating risk from one town to another. For
                        instance, some have asked, “What if my vehicle is parked in a garage?” Unfortunately, in most
                        instances where you park is irrelevant..</p>
                    <h2><strong>Experience</strong></h2>

                    <p>Unlike states that determine experience based on driver age, Massachusetts considers experience
                        based upon the actual number of years licensed. It doesn’t matter if you were first licensed in
                        another country, if you can prove licensure most carriers will accept it. Otherwise, you pay a
                        higher premium if you have less than three years of driving experience and/or more than three
                        years but less than six years.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>Driving History</strong></h2>
                    <p>Incurring points on your driving record costs you dearly, no doubt about it. Everyone starts with
                        a score of 00. From there, you can go up or down to 99 or 98. Anything that’s not a 99, 98, or
                        00 incurs a surcharge which has a tremendous impact on rate and acceptability to carriers. ”At
                        fault” accidents are also heavily penalized. Even not at fault, frequent glass claims, and
                        hit-and-run incidents are heavily weighted against the insured when it comes to premiums.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Coverage</strong></h2>
                    <p>Insurance coverage is like buying a car, the more options you add the more costly it becomes.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Vehicle</strong></h2>
                    <p>You can’t expect to pay the same for a Maserati as you do for a Ford. If it’s a luxury vehicle,
                        you will pay more, even if it’s an older model.</p>
                    <h2><strong>Carrier</strong></h2>
                    <p>Rates differ from carrier to carrier. Sometimes it’s a slight difference and sometimes it can be
                        a significant one. Carriers adjust their rates at the minimum every year, therefore, it’s likely
                        you’ll see a rate increase yearly or semi-annually.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="mt-lg-3">From shopping your policies around with our carriers to finding you the most
                        affordable coverage to suit your needs, <a href="./index.html">Econosurance </a> has you
                        covered. Below are some ways that have proven to save our clients money while meticulously
                        protecting their assets.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        <strong>Higher deductible</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p>A deductible is the dollar amount out of pocket that you are responsible for paying toward a
                        covered loss. The higher your deductible, the more money you are likely to save on your
                        insurance premium. For example, with a $1,000 deductible, you may reduce your insurance rate by
                        $500 or more.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Bundle Homeowners and Auto Policies</strong></h4>
                    <p>Many insurers who sell <a href="./index.html">homeowners insurance</a> also offer a bundling
                        discount. If you buy two or more insurance policies from the same carrier, you may be eligible
                        to receive a discount. To ensure you’re getting the best price, agents at Econosurance make
                        certain any combined price from one insurer is lower than buying the coverages separately from
                        different companies.</p>

                    <p>Having insurance on everything you own is undoubtedly expensive—but it is also your protection
                        against potential disaster and financial losses. Insurance rates vary from company to company,

                    <ul>
                        <li> Consider insurance rates in the area where you plan to buy or rent a home.</li>
                        <li> Driving history is important. If you can avoid moving violations and accidents, you will
                            save yourself a lot of money on auto insurance and carriers will fight for your business.
                            It’s a good situation to be in.</li>
                        <li> You have leverage on coverage; you can save a bundle by increasing your deductible to buy
                            more coverage.</li>
                        <li> You always have the option to buy a cheaper car, but if you opt for a luxury vehicle, be
                            prepared to pay a premium for insurance.</li>
                        <li> Unless you are a delinquent driver, you can find great savings shopping for carriers. You
                            can also decide to switch at any time. In auto insurance as in life, there are consequences
                            for overstaying your welcome.</li>

                    <p>Last winter, Charlie Wilson was driving his black sedan when he skidded off the road and hit a
                        post. Fortunately, he wasn’t hurt and the damage to his car was mostly cosmetic, so he thought
                        that his auto insurance Franklin MA, which included collision coverage, would have no problem
                        paying for the repairs. Wilson lives in a

                    <p> When Steve Rosevear turned 16, he asked his parents if he could apply for his learner’s permit
                        and be added to their existing auto insurance. Steve’s parents faced a conundrum: would it be
                        more economical to add their son to their existing car insurance, or get him his own policy?
                        While adding teenage drivers to an existing policy can result in higher insurance rates, in many
                        cases this route remains cheaper than getting them a separate policy. After all, most insurers
                        give discounts to families who insure multiple cars and/or carry car and home insurance with the
                        same company. <a href="./Teenage Driver.html">Read more...</a></p>

                    <p>Many drivers don’t understand the exact extent of their coverage. While Rob had liability and
                        collision coverage, it did not include accidents with animals, which is typically covered by
                        comprehensive insurance. Comprehensive auto insurance is commonly confused with collision. While
                        both pay for car repairs or replacement in the event of a total loss, they cover different
                        events. Collision insurance pays for the damages in an accident with another vehicle or object
                        (e.g., mailbox, fence, or tree), whereas comprehensive covers anything other than collisions
                        such as damages caused by weather and other acts of nature, fire, theft, vandalism, and
                        accidents involving animals. Read more...</p>

                    <p>Isaac Silva often brings along his two dogs on his camping adventures over the last three years.
                        He recently moved to Barnstable, Massachusetts, the largest community in both land area and
                        population on Cape Cod, known for its hundreds of miles of hiking trails. While he has
                        comprehensive auto insurance Barnstable MA, he wanted to make sure it would cover injuries to
                        his pets in the event of an auto accident.</p>
                    <p>Silva’s predicament is not unique. According to a recent survey, more than half of US dog owners
                        take their pets on a car trip at least once a month. </p>

                    <p>While the property crime rate (car theft and burglary) in Massachusetts has always been
                        considerably lower than the national rate, Leslie Williams still felt she needed comprehensive
                        auto insurance coverage in Holyoke MA.</p>
                    <p>Comprehensive coverage typically covers the damages from theft, fire, vandalism, falling debris,
                        natural disasters, and animal-caused damages. In a nutshell, this optional type of coverage pays
                        for your car’s repairs or replacement in the event of damages that are not incurred as the
                        result of an auto accident. Because not all policies are the same, it’s important to make sure
                        that you always read the fine print and compare insurance rates and clauses from different
                        insurers. Read more</p>

                    <p>While “full coverage” is a loosely defined term, most industry experts agree that it typically
                        combines three scopes of protection: state-required liability coverage, collision coverage, and

                    <p>In general, your auto insurance policy covers all the drivers in a household. The same thing is
                        true for non-household members such as friends, roommates, etc., who borrow your vehicle once in
                        a while. (Note: If a non-household relative or friend borrows your car regularly, you should
                        list him or her on your policy. Failure to do so can lead to claim denial should an accident
                        occur.). Read more.</p>

                    <p>When Steve Rosevear turned 16, he asked his parents if he could apply for his learner’s permit
                        and be added to their existing auto insurance. His family lives in Amesbury, Massachusetts, a
                        small city in Essex County that lies across the Merrimack River and is one of the two
                        northernmost towns in the state. Steve’s parents faced a conundrum: would it be more economical
                        to add their son to their existing car insurance, or get him his own policy? </p>

                    <p>While adding teenage drivers to an existing policy can result in higher insurance rates, in many
                        cases this route remains cheaper than getting them a separate policy. After all, most insurers
                        give discounts to families who insure multiple cars and/or carry car and home insurance with the
                        same company. Read more</p>

                        new home from scratch. Your insurance agent or insurance company representative will have
                        knowledge of your neighborhood, and familiarity with the construction materials used when your
                        home was originally built and can accurately calculate this cost. Read more about shopping for

                    <p>What is Covered under a “Standard” Homeowners Insurance?</p>
                    <p>As defined by the Insurance Information Institute on their website, four essential types of
                        coverage are included in a standard Homeowners Policy. They include:</p>
                    <p>The structure of your house</p>
                    <p>This part of your homeowner's insurance policy pays to repair or rebuild your home if it is
                        damaged or destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail, lightning, or other disaster listed in your
                        policy. It will not pay for damage caused by a flood, earthquake, or routine wear and tear. When
                        purchasing coverage for the structure of your home, it is important to buy enough to rebuild

                    </h2>
                    <p>One of the most expensive and inconvenient truths about bitterly cold winters is resulting in
                        water damage due to the heat being turned off in apartments. I have come up with a few things a
                        landlord can do to effectively encourage tenants to turn on the heat and keep it on, and perhaps
                        also bolster the landlord-tenant relationship in the process.</p>

                    <p>If you’re a homeowner like I am, you understand how difficult it is to ensure that tenants keep
                        their apartments heated during the winter months. The fact is, tenants are most likely trying to
                        save money but may be unaware of the consequences of turning off the heat during cold snaps.
                        Unfortunately, that awareness usually hits when they turn on the heat, the pipes burst, and
                        water floods their apartments. Read more about water damage due to no heat.</p>
