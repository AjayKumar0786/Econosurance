							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>Top 7 Reasons Why You Need Hazard Insurance For Your
									Home</strong></h2>
							<p class="own-mobile-text mt-lg-3">Are you planning to build your very own home?

							</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">Mortgage companies require you to apply for hazard insurance
								first before they give out a loan. This type of insurance under homeowners insurance not
								only protects their investment but yours too! Studies show that over <a
									href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/nearly-one-third-us-homes-natural-disaster-high-risk-new-study-says.html">
									35 million homes </a> are at high risk during natural disasters</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">Aside from hail, lighting, and fallen trees, you may also
								experience fire damage. This is where hazard insurance comes in. Read on to learn more
								about hazard insurance and why you need it.

							</p>

							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>What is Hazard Insurance?</strong></h2>




							<p class="own-mobile-text "> Hazards, or perils, under <a
									href="./Home-owners-insurance.html"> homeowners insurance</a> are often classified
								under weather damage. However, it also covers fire damage, vandalism, theft, and even
								explosions.
							</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">These perils can come in two sub-classes:' named perils' and
								'open perils.' This will determine how much coverage you get if you ever encounter any
								of the above issues.</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">
								<a href="https://www.lemonade.com/insuropedia/dictionary/named-perils/"> Named
									perils</a> to include a list of 16 classified named disasters or hazards. If any of
								these 16 bad things happen, your home insurance company will pay for them. Opens perils
								coverage covers the cost of damaged possessions from all causes except those your policy
								specifically excludes.
							</p>

							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>1. Dwelling and Structure Coverage</strong></h2>


							<p class="own-mobile-text "> One big reason why you need hazard insurance is its
								dwelling and structure coverages. Accidents and disasters are unpredictable and can
								happen at any time. Even with preparation, you may still need repairs or replacements
								after a disaster.</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">
								Dwelling coverages protect the incurred damages on the physical structure of your home.
								For instance, wildfires destroy half of your house's walls, or a hailstorm destroys some
								of your shingles. Your hazard insurance's dwelling coverage will handle any of these
								cases.</p>






							<p class="own-mobile-text"> Other structure coverages cover other structures in your
								property apart from the house. These would include damaged fences, sheds, or detached
								garages.</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">
								For cases when a storm breaks down your property's fences, you'll be able to get some
								help from your hazard insurance to pay the repairs or replacements.
							</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">Policy coverages can change depending on which state you live in.
								However, most <a href="./homeowners-insurance-Why Should I Bother.html">
								homeowner's insurance</a> policies cover damages from most natural disasters. This includes storms, fire, and
								lightning strikes.</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">The only exception is flood damages, which are not covered in
								most hazard insurances. This is because sometimes it's subsection insurance in many home
								insurance companies. If you also wish to get flood insurance, talk to your house
								insurance provider.</p>


							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>2. Protects your Liability</strong></h2>

							<p class="own-mobile-text "> When it comes to hazard insurance, it not only covers
								your structural issues. Some insurance policies can also protect you in lawsuit cases
								from injuries that happen on your property.
							</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text"> If a neighbor's kid decides to enter your property and gets hurt
								while they're there, you won't get held accountable. Hazard insurance helps you to pay
								for the necessary legal fees in case your neighbors decide to sue.
							</p>



							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>3. Covers Vandalism and Theft Incidences</strong></h2>

							<p class="own-mobile-text ">Many house insurance policies cover cases of theft and
								vandalism. However, it's best to check on your policy to know how much coverage you can
								get in these circumstances.

							</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">Breaking and entering often cause valuable possessions in your
								home to get taken. Stolen high-value jewelry like diamond earrings is also covered in
								your hazard insurance. Your home insurance company can help you pay for these valuable
								items.
							</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">However, it's crucial to note that you must inform them about
								this beforehand. If your insurance company doesn't know you have high-value jewelry in
								your home before a theft incident, you may not be able to get coverage.</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">There may also be instances when your vandalism claim <a
									href="./the-power-of-rejection.html">can get denied</a>. This can happen because of
								negligence or if your house has been vacant for over two months or 60 days.</p>

							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>
									4. It Covers All Your Personal Property
								</strong></h2>
							<p class="own-mobile-text "> Another thing about hazard insurance is that it covers
								damages on personal property. Personal property refers to any of your belongings, from
								clothes to houseware.
							</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text"> For example, your television set either gets stolen or damaged
								during a fire. Your home insurance can then help pay to replace the damaged or stolen
								items.

							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>5. It Has A Loss of Use Coverage</strong></h2>
							<p class="own-mobile-text "> Your HMI's hazard insurance also has a loss of use
								coverage. This is what others call <a
									href="https://uphelp.org/claim-guidance-publications/survivors-speak-additional-living-expense-ale-loss-of-use/">
									Additional Living Expenses (ALE) insurance.</a> Some call it Coverage D.</p>




							<p class="own-mobile-text"> This coverage means that your home insurance can pay for any
								extra costs for housing and living expenses. This is crucial if your house is under
								repair or renovations.</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">
								ALE also compensates for extra expenses from temporary relocation after a covered loss.
								A good example would be having lost your home due to a wildfire. The Loss of Use
								coverage can reimburse you for the costs of hotels and such.</p>

							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>6. It Covers Medical Bills</strong></h2>




							<p class="own-mobile-text "> Medical payment coverage helps with the medical bills of
								people who get hurt on your property. This can include family members or even strangers.
							</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">
								This coverage also acts as a financial shield for minor injuries. Apart from that, it
								will help you avoid an injured person suing you for monetary compensation. </p>
							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>7. Your Mortgage Loan Provider Requires It</strong></h2>




							<p class="own-mobile-text "> The final important reason is that your lender would
								need you to have one. Hazard insurance is the only policy under house insurance that
								covers your home's structure. Your mortgage loan provider requires you to have hazard
								insurance before they can issue you a loan.</p>

							<h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>The 7 Important Reasons Of Having A Hazard Insurance For Your
									Home</strong></h2>




							<p class="own-mobile-text "> Hazard insurance is an important subsection of your
								insurance policy. They help cover your home and property, your damaged or stolen
								belongings, and extra living expenses. Not only that, but they also protect your
								liability by covering legal and medical fees.</p>
							<p class="own-mobile-text">
								While lenders often need you to have one before getting a loan, it's a great thing to
								have to protect your personal property. Learn more about homeowners' insurances by
								contacting us today. </p>
