                            <h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>What? How Dare You!</strong></h2>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text ">Whether it comes in the form of a letter following an
                                application for a new job, an ominous beep from a credit card machine, or from a
                                girlfriend or boyfriend with the claim of “it’s not you, it’s me”, rejection is never
                                nice.

                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">The wide range of feelings that can arise from such a fate may
                                often conclude with a prompt to put it behind you and move on. However, for many people,
                                this desire only tends to arise after a period of questioning with the main one being
                                “why?” </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">People often can’t move on without knowing why they were
                                rejected, even if it’s not personal – it feels personal. </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">This can even be the case even if the rejection comes from an
                                insurance company – yes, an insurance company! That faceless corporate organization that
                                you have no real personal connection with can have the audacity to decline to give you a
                                quote. Alongside the feelings of annoyance, frustration, disappointment, or maybe even
                                outrage, there will be the question of why they don’t want to give you a quote. </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">
                                Besides the emotion involved, there are practicalities that need to be dealt with as
                                being refused insurance can leave you in a precarious position. It will force you to
                                seek out a specialist insurance company (read: more expensive premiums!) or self-insure,
                                in which case it is impossible to predict the potential loss that could be suffered.
                                Rejection can be even more of a worry when it has come following an application for a <a
                                    href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-law-about-auto-insurance#massachusetts-regulations-">
                                    compulsory insurance </a> type.

                            <p class="own-mobile-text">
                                Even the <a href="./index.html">best home insurance companies</a> will have some risks
                                that fall within their exclusions section and, similarly, they will have a range of
                                issues that will act as a red flag for them and make them err on the side of caution.
                                However, if you understand the reasons why insurers do the things they do, you will be
                                better placed to know how to respond.
                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">
                                Are you ready for a revelation? Insurers don’t like to lose money. Shocking, right?
                                Maybe this plays a part in why insurance companies have a bad reputation, but who knows…
                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">
                                Anyway, insurance companies spend much time and effort on calculating the potential of a
                                risk occurring, which is what they engage actuaries to do. Insurance is big business and
                                highly profitable, which is not going to remain the case if they provide coverage to
                                just anybody – they want to know what they’re getting into.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="mt-lg-4
       "><strong>Water, Water Everywhere</strong></h3>




                            <p class="own-mobile-text "> If you live close to a body of water, you probably
                                consider yourself quite lucky. Anything from the smallest stream to the largest ocean
                                will offer you a reprieve from the hustle of urban life that can make you think of your
                                home as a little special. However, insurers might consider your home special for an
                                entirely different reason.
                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">Even if you have never had an issue with water ingress into your
                                home, many insurers will still not want to take the risk. Accordingly, they may decline
                                to provide you with a quote, so you may not be able to get the <a
                                    href=" https://econosurance.com/home-insurance-quote"> best home insurance</a> for
                                your needs. </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">
                                In this situation, there may be other factors that can make an insurer wary of providing
                                a quote, such as subsidence or sinkholes, which may result from being close to water.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>Shut Up and Drive</strong></h3>


                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> We would all love to be able to simply get into a car
                                and drive. Whether for the purpose of work or play, having the freedom to be able to use
                                your car in this way is the ultimate desire. However, there are a few necessary steps
                                that you must complete before being able to get behind the wheel. Part of this process
                                will be getting suitable car insurance, which can be difficult in certain circumstances.
                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">
                                Having a classic or high-end car can make it difficult to get coverage from a standard
                                insurance company, or you may find yourself only being quoted very high premium rates.
                                This is due to the potential loss being higher than average. </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">This would also be something that is quite familiar to parents of
                                children who have successfully obtained their permits. The next step will be to add them
                                to an existing <a href="https://econosurance.com/lowest-car-insurance-massachusetts">
                                    car insurance policy</a> , which is not exactly going to get you a discount! It may
                                be galling, but there is a method to the madness when it comes to a new driver as they
                                have less experience on the road and are more likely to have an accident. </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">
                                People who drive for a living or do a lot of driving for their job may find themselves
                                only being offered excessively high quotes, which can be almost as bad as a declinature
                                when the premium is outside your budget. It stands to reason that the longer you are on
                                the road, the greater the possibility of being involved in an accident.
                            </p>










                            <h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>No Trees, No Shade</strong></h2>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text ">Trees are great, aren’t they? They provide shade,
                                sometimes things you can eat, clean the air, provide homes for squirrels and birds, and
                                add a touch of green to gray urban streets. It is easy to recognize all of these
                                positives by simply looking at trees, but this makes it easy to forget about what is
                                going on beneath the surface – and there is a lot going on beneath the surface.

                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">In order for all of the visible aspects of a tree to be made
                                possible, it is necessary for it to have good roots. These big strong roots anchor the
                                tree to the ground and help feed and nourish it. As part of this process they will
                                spread out and take up space even where there is none – they will make space. In order
                                to do this, they will force the movement of most things in their way, including the
                                foundations of a house.
                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">When there is a risk of ground movement and damage to
                                foundations, even the best home insurance company will think twice before providing a
                                homeowner’s insurance quote for a property that has trees close to its boundary. </p>


                            <h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>

                            <p class="own-mobile-text "> Having a roof over your head should be a given, but it
                                can often seem more like a privilege and one that helps you feel secure. You can close
                                your door and feel protected against the elements and people with bad intentions, but
                                others may not see it this way.
                            </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> Of course, the “others” we’re referring to are insurance
                                companies. They don’t love your home as you do, they don’t care how you feel about it,
                                they just need to be satisfied that it is the type of property that they are prepared to
                                cover.
                            <p class="own-mobile-text">n the event that you live in a property that could be considered
                                susceptible to an insured risk, an insurance company would be less likely to provide you
                                with a quote. For example, a property that is in a poor state of repair at the intended
                                inception date of a <a href="https://econosurance.com/home-insurance-quote"> homeowner’s
                                    policy </a> is not likely to be given a quote from even the best insurance company;
                                this is a given and many would expect it. </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> People that own other types of property may be surprised at not
                                being able to easily get a quote as they think it is perfectly insurable. However,
                                insurers may not see it this way. Properties that are made from non-standard materials
                                can make insurance companies nervous as they may present a greater risk. For example,
                                properties mainly constructed from timber or which comprise thatched roofs may be more
                                likely to suffer fires, which will increase the potential loss to an insurer if they
                                provide coverage. </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> Rejection is powerful. It can cause self-examination,
                                self-loathing, panic, embarrassment, anxiety, even hate. However, you don’t need to let
                                it get that serious when you know what you are dealing with. </p>
                            <p class="own-mobile-text"> At least with an insurance company, you can console yourself
                                with the knowledge that it is not personal and that there are other steps you can take,
                                such as in the form of making changes or using specialist insurance companies (with whom
                                we have close relationships).</p>
