                        <h1> <strong>Homeowners </strong>Insurance </h1>
                        <p>A homeowners insurance policy provides coverage for your dwelling’s structure and your
                            possessions against perils such as fire, lightning, hail, burst or frozen pipes, theft, and
                            vandalism.</p>
                        <p> A Homeowners insurance quote is presented as a package policy. This means that it has both
                            coverages for property and liability or legal responsibility for any injuries and property
                            damage policyholders or their families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by
                            household pets.</p>

                        <p>Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. <a
                                href="./Home-owners-insurance.html">Standard homeowners policies </a> do not cover
                            flooding, earthquakes, or poor maintenance. Flood coverage is provided by the federal
                            government’s National Flood Insurance Program, although it is purchased from an insurance
                            agent. Earthquake coverage is available either in the form of an endorsement or as a
                            separate policy. Most maintenance-related problems are the homeowners’ responsibility.</p>

                    <h2>How To Read A
                        <strong> Homeowners Insurance</strong>Quote
                    </h2>
                    <p><strong> A homeowners insurance quote includes</strong></p>
                    <h6><strong>1. Coverage for the structure of the home</strong></h6>
                    <p class="mt-lg-2">This part of a policy pays to repair or rebuild a home if it is damaged or
                        destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail, lightning, or other disaster listed in the policy. It will
                        not pay for damage caused by a flood, earthquake, or routine wear and tear. Most standard
                        policies also cover structures that are not attached to a house such as a garage, tool shed, or
                        gazebo.</p>
                    <h6><strong>2. Coverage for personal belongings</strong></h6>
                    <p>Furniture, clothes, sports equipment, and other personal items are covered if they are stolen or
                        destroyed by fire, hurricane, or other insured disasters. Most companies provide coverage for 50
                        to 70 percent of the amount of insurance on the structure of a home. This part of the policy
                        includes off-premises coverage. This means that belongings are covered anywhere in the world
                        unless the policyholder has decided against off-premises coverage. </p>



                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 small-lists-text">
                    <p>Expensive items like jewelry, furs, and silverware are covered, but there are usually dollar
                        limits if they are stolen. To insure these items to their full value, individuals can purchase a
                        special personal property endorsement or floater and insure the item for its appraised value.
                    </p>
                    <p>Trees, plants, and shrubs are also covered under standard homeowners insurance—generally up to
                        about $500 per item. Perils covered are theft, fire, lightning, explosion, vandalism, riot and
                        even falling aircraft. They are not covered for damage by wind or disease.
                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>3. Liability protection</strong></h6>
                    <p>Liability covers lawsuits for bodily injury or property damage that policyholders or family
                        members cause to other people. It also pays for damage caused by pets. The liability portion of
                        the policy pays for both the cost of defending the policyholder in court and any court awards—up
                        to the limit of the policy. Coverage is not just in the home but extends to anywhere in the
                        world. Liability limits generally start at about $100,000. An umbrella or excess liability
                        policy, which provides broader coverage, including claims for libel and slander, as well as
                        higher liability limits, can be added to the policy.</p>

                    <h6><strong>4. Additional living expenses</strong></h6>
                    <p>This pays the additional costs of living away from home if a house is inhabitable due to damage
                        from a fire, storm, or other insured disasters. It covers hotel bills, restaurant meals, and
                        other living expenses incurred while the home is being rebuilt. Coverage for additional living
                        expenses differs from company to company.</p>

                    <h2> Compare <strong>Homeowners Insurance </strong>Policies </h2>
                    <p class="mb-0"> The different types of homeowners policies are fairly standard throughout the
                        country. However, individual states and companies may offer policies that are slightly different
                        or go by other names such as “standard” or “deluxe.”</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HO2 (Homeowners Broad Form) This form of insurance provides broad form coverage on your
                            dwelling and other structures and insures against loss of use. To be specific, the broad
                            form of coverage insures against windstorms, hail, aircraft, riots, vandalism, vehicles,
                            volcanic, explosion, smoke, fire, lightning, and theft, plus rupture of a system,
                            artificially generated electricity, falling objects, and freezing of plumbing.</li>
                        <li>HO3 (Homeowners Special Form): This “special form” insurance offers coverage for more causes
                            of loss than the HO2. It provides coverage for the structure of the home and personal
                            belongings as well as personal liability coverage. Owners of multi-family homes generally
                            purchase an HO-3 with an endorsement to cover the risks associated with having renters live
                            in their houses.</li>

                            include loss to a tube, transistor or similar electronic component).</li>
                        <li>HO4 (Homeowners Contents Broad Form): This is a renter’s policy. Even if you don’t own your
                            home, you should consider having this type of insurance. Your landlord’s insurance will not
                            cover damage to your personal property or liability against you. Think about how much it
                            will cost to replace all of your furniture, clothing etc. If you feel this isn’t a loss you
                            could bear, consider buying this type of insurance.</li>
                        <li> HO5 (Homeowners Comprehensive Form): This type of policy essentially combines the HO3 form
                            with the HO5 endorsement into one comprehensive form to provide open perils coverage on
                            personal property in addition to the dwelling, other structures, and loss of use. The HO5
                            rider can only be combined with an HO3 policy.</li>
                        <li> HO6 (Homeowners Unit Owners Form): This is a condominium policy. This type of policy is
                            different from a homeowners insurance policy in that it is designed for individuals who live
                            in a unit structure owned and insured by a condo association, townhouse association
                            cooperative, homeowner’s association, planned community or other similar type of
                            organization. The insurance the association provides only covers the outside dwelling, not
                            the contents of your unit, so it’s important to consider purchasing this type of insurance
                            to protect against personal property losses and liability.</li>
                        <li> HO8 (Homeowners 8, Modified Coverage Form): This form of insurance settles losses on an
                            actual cash value basis and is usually only used to cover older structures where the cost of
                            replacement far exceeds the value of the structure. This type of insurance is offered when
                            insurers are not willing to offer HO2, HO3 or HO5 coverages because there may be an
                            incentive to intentionally destroy the structure.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Ordinance or Law: If the dwelling does not comply with current local building codes, the
                            insurance company will not be liable for the cost of improved construction to bring the
                            structure up to code. Do you live in an older home? Here in Massachusetts, this may very
                            well apply to.</li>
                        <li> Various Earth Movements: This includes two distinct types of earth movements, including
                            shifting earth (landslides, mudslides, and sinkholes come to mind) in the foundation of a
                            home and earthquakes. These may be considered two separate coverage areas, so being covered
                            for one may not mean being covered for the other.</li>
                        <li> <a href="./Water damage due to no heat.html">Water Damage:</a> This includes floods from
                            nature, water backing up in sewers or drains, as we ll as water seeping which might seep
                            through basement walls, etc.</li>
                        <li> Neglect: Your policy will exclude losses from damages resulting from direct or indirect
                            neglect and/or the failure of the policyholder to use reasonable means to protect and
                            properly maintain the property.</li>
                        <li> War: All damage caused by any type of war or nuclear weapons attack is excluded.</li>
                        <li> Nuclear Hazard: This is defined as any nuclear reaction, radiation, or radioactive
                            contamination, (whether the condition is under controlled or uncontrolled circumstance).
                            Loss by nuclear hazard is specifically not defined as loss caused by fire, explosion, or
                            smoke, even if these perils are specifically named in your policy.</li>
                        <li> Intentional Loss: Any damage that is intentionally inflicted to one’s own property is
                            excluded – and for obvious reasons.</li>
                    </ol>



                    <p>As with any type of insurance, it is critical that you read the insurance policy so that you know
                        exactly what it will cover. The amount of coverage you should consider should be based on the
                        replacement cost value of your home or property. Replacement costs on one’s dwelling provide
                        that if at the time of loss, the amount of insurance covers at least 80% of the replacement cost
                        of the dwelling, the loss will be paid on a replacement cost basis. Keep in mind that this still
                        leaves the homeowner on the hook for the remaining 20% in the event of a total loss.</p>
                    <p>Oftentimes, the bank or institution holding your mortgage will require that you maintain a
                        specific amount of coverage. However, even if your home is paid off, you should still consider
                        having the appropriate amount of insurance protection, which might include coverage for physical
                        damage as well as liability protection for the owners.

                    </p>
                    <h2 class="mt-lg-4"><strong>Home Owners Insurance Coverage</strong></h2>
                    <p> Below are a few coverage endorsements in a homeowners insurance quote that help you compare
                        homeowners insurance rates.</p>
                    <h6><strong>1. Actual Cash Value</strong></h6>
                    <p>This policy pays to replace the home or possessions minus a deduction for depreciation.

                    </p>
                    <h6><strong>2. Replacement Cost</strong></h6>
                    <p>This policy pays the cost of rebuilding or repairing the home or replacing possessions without a
                        deduction for depreciation.</p>

                    <h6><strong>3. Guaranteed/Extended Replacement Cost</strong></h6>
                    <p>This policy offers the highest level of protection. A guaranteed replacement cost policy pays
                        whatever it costs to rebuild the home as it was before the fire or other disaster—even if it
                        exceeds the policy limit. This gives protection against sudden increases in construction costs
                        due to a shortage of building materials after a widespread disaster or other unexpected
                        situations. It generally won’t cover the cost of upgrading the house to comply with current
                        building codes. However, an endorsement (or an addition to) the policy called Ordinance or Law
                        can help pay for these additional costs.</p>
                    <p>Some insurance companies offer an extended, rather than a guaranteed, replacement cost policy. An
                        extended policy pays a certain percentage over the limit to rebuild the home. Generally, it is
                        20 to 25 percent more than the limit of the policy. For example, if homeowners take out a policy
                        for $100,000, they can get up to an extra $20,000 or $25,000 of coverage. Guaranteed and
                        extended replacement cost policies are more expensive, but they offer the best financial
                        protection against disasters for a home. These coverages, however, may not be available in all
                        states or from all companies. Replacement cost coverage is available for the structure of the
                        home, but only actual cash value coverage is available for possessions.</p>
